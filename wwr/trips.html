                <img src="images/rafting17_600.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Our mission is to bridge the gap between human spirit and the untamed
                    wilderness
                    by providing safe,
                    exhilarating, and world-class river adventures. We are dedicated to
                    environmental stewardship, using
                    every trip as an opportunity to educate our guests on river ecology and the
                    vital importance of
                    preserving our planet’s natural water corridors. Through expert guiding and
                    a
                    commitment to personal
                    growth, we strive to transform a simple day on the water into a lifelong
                    passion
                    for the great
                    outdoors.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Origins – 1840s
                Although rafts had previously been around for centuries and used by
                indigenous
                peoples, constructed
                using natural materials like logs and reeds, contemporary inflatable rafts
                as we
                know them today
                first appeared in the 1840s. This first version was constructed by
                Lieutenant
                John Fremont and
                Horace H. Day, who built the raft with the intention of surveying the Rocky
                Mountains and Great
                Plains via the Snake River in the Pacific Northwest. However, their attempt
                ultimately failed as the
                rough waters proved to be too aggressive for this early constructed raft and
                ultimately destroyed
                it. But this first contemporary voyage would prompt further scientific
                expeditions.</p>
