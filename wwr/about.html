                    by providing safe,
                    exhilarating, and world-class river adventures. We are dedicated to
                    environmental stewardship, using
                    every trip as an opportunity to educate our guests on river ecology and the

                    preserving our planet’s natural water corridors. Through expert guiding and a
                    commitment to personal
                    growth, we strive to transform a simple day on the water into a lifelong passion

                <p>The Origins – 1840s
                    Although rafts had previously been around for centuries and used by indigenous
                    peoples, constructed
                    using natural materials like logs and reeds, contemporary inflatable rafts as we
                    know them today
                    first appeared in the 1840s. This first version was constructed by Lieutenant
                    John Fremont and
                    Horace H. Day, who built the raft with the intention of surveying the Rocky
                    Mountains and Great
                    Plains via the Snake River in the Pacific Northwest. However, their attempt
                    ultimately failed as the
                    rough waters proved to be too aggressive for this early constructed raft and
                    ultimately destroyed
                    it. But this first contemporary voyage would prompt further scientific
                    expeditions.</p>

                <p>SOngoing Attempts – 1940s
                    It was not until a hundred years later when a significant development took place
                    with the
                    reintroduction of the rubber raft following its popularization in a military
                    context as well as its
                    development for use as a lifeboat. With the availability of military surplus
                    rafts, it’s around this
                    time that recreational rafting starts to gain its initial footholds. Next, (as
                    there often is with
                    history) the claim to the first commercial whitewater rafting trip appears to be
                    disputed between
                    Clyde Smith’s June 1940 trip through Snake River Canyon, and a separate claim of
                    a trip which also
                    supposedly also took place in June 1940 on the Salmon River. Which,
                    additionally, is believed to be
                    the location of the first-ever rafting company.
