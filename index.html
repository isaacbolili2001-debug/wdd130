        <p>
            (DRC), country located in Central Africa. Officially known as the Democratic Republic of
            the Congo, the
            country has
            a 25-mile (40-km) coastline on the Atlantic Ocean but is otherwise landlocked. It is the
            second
            largest country on the continent; only Algeria is larger. The capital, Kinshasa, is
            located on the
            Congo River about 320 miles (515 km) from its mouth. The largest city in central Africa,
            it serves
            as the country’s official administrative, economic, and cultural center. The country is
            often
            referred to by its acronym, the DRC, or called Congo (Kinshasa), with the capital added
            parenthetically, to distinguish it from the other Congo republic, which is officially
            called the
            Republic of the Congo and is often referred to as Congo (Brazzaville).
